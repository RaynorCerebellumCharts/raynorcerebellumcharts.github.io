# About the project
The aim of this project is to develop and improve normative models of cerebellar development and ageing.
While often ignored in neuroimaging studies, the cerebellum plays an important role in cognitive and motor development. Deficits in cortico-cerebellar communication have been implicated in a range of developmental and neuropsychiatric conditions, including autism, ADHD, and schizophrenia.

We are aiming to develop on open-science standard for the anatomical and functional analysis of the human cerebellum across the entire lifespan. Normative models provide age- and sex-specific norms for anatomical and functional markers, allowing researchers and clinicians to quantify deviations from that norm in clinical studies and in individuals. This can accelerate clinical discovery, and will improve diagnosis and disease prediction for individual patients.

## Principle Investigators
